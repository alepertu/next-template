Deps managed by Yarn Berry, no installs required.

## Getting Started

Fork and get going. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Edit src/app/page.tsx and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

## Included packages

### React 18

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. See [v18 docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/).

### Next.js 13

React framework that extends its functionality. See [v13 docs](https://nextjs.org/docs). This project uses the experimental app folder and server components.

### Typescript 4.9

TypeScript turns JavaScript in a strongly typed programming language. See [v4.9 docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

### TailwindCSS 3

A CSS framework that allows styling directly using classes in the markup. See [v3 docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### Jest 29

A JavaScript Testing Framework. See [v29 docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started). testing-library allows testing React components via Jest. See [testing-library-react docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

### Prettier & ESLint

Prettier is a code formatter that helps mantaining code clean. See [Prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html). ESLint analyzes code searching for errors, problems and bad practices. See [ESLint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started).

### Husky, lint-staged & commitlint

Husky runs Git Hooks on different git operations. See [Husky docs](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=features).
lint-staged runs linters and formatters on commit.
commitlint enforces conventional commit messages.
